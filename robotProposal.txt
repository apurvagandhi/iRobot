Name of robot: 
Marvin

Description of our activity:

We will have our robot enter a maze and successfully reach the exit while knocking down small objects (paper stick figures) along the way. The robot will play a song and light up when it hits a wall.

5 functions we plan to use from iRobot.h

1: KillSong();

	We will use this function to stop playing the song once the robot has finished 		turning after hitting a wall.

2: PlaySong();

	We will use this function to play a song when the robot hits a wall.

3: SetRobotLEDs();

	We will use this function to light up the LEDs on the robot when it hits a wall.

4: IsEitherBumperPressed();

	We will use this function to have the robot take a series of turns once it has hit 		a wall.

5: WaitForBump();
   Straight();
   Turn();

	We will use all three of these functions for driving the robot through the maze.
